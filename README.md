## What is this?

Simply put, this is a shell script (`imx.sh`) that extracts the text of all messages from an iMessage database, and places them in a series of text files organized by telephone number. It works on recent versions of macOS - it has been verified to work on Catalina 10.15.5. There has been no extensive testing to date; this should be considered experimental software. 

## Working with Apple's security
The simplest method to enable `imx.sh` to run is to give the `Terminal.app` Full Disk Access in `System Preferences`.

## What is the provenance of this code? 

Please refer to the Wiki. 

## How do I use this? 

1. Copy the script to your local machine - at least two ways to do this: 

    - My *preferred* way is that you fork or clone this repo, and submit pull requests to incorporate any improvements you think worthwhile. 

    - Another way is to simply copy the contents of `imx.sh` to your machine, save it as a file and make it executable using `chmod 755 ./imx.sh`
    
2. Once you have an executable copy of `imx.sh`, `cd` to that folder - e.g. `cd /Users/<yourusername>/MyScripts`: 

    ```
    mkdir extract
    ./baskup.sh
    ```

    Depending upon the size of your iMessage database & the other usual variables, this should finish "quickly" - 2-10 seconds? When it completes, you will find the folder you created is now populated with a series of folders and files. You may review them using `less`, which should result in something similar to the following. Note that this output reflects only two "conversations" in the database - you may have more than that. In this context a "conversation" is simply another number/person with whom you have exchanged messages: 
    
    ```
    ls -lR ./extract | less 
     % ls -lR ./backup
    total 0
    drwxr-xr-x  4 tuser  staff  128 Jun 21 21:55 +12345678901
    drwxr-xr-x  4 tuser  staff  128 Jun 21 21:55 +12345074321

    ./backup/+12345678901:
    total 32
    drwxr-xr-x  2 tuser  staff     64 Jun 21 21:55 Attachments
    -rw-r--r--@ 1 tuser  staff  16361 Jun 22 01:10 iMessage;-;+12345678901.txt

    ./backup/+12345678901/Attachments:

    ./backup/+12345074321:
    total 8
    drwxr-xr-x  2 tuser  staff  64 Jun 21 21:55 Attachments
    -rw-r--r--  1 tuser  staff  83 Jun 22 01:10 iMessage;-;+12345074321.txt

    ./backup/+12345074321/Attachments:
    ```

    Also note that `ls -lR` is the **recursive** form of the *list* command, and so we see everything in the `./extract` folder listed. The text files (e.g. `iMessage;-;+12345678901.txt` may be opened in your text editor, and/or processed by another script. Each message is a 'record' in the file formatted roughly as follows: 
    
    >Name (Me or Friend) | Text of message | date-time stamp
    
    There is a single option available with imx.sh: `imx.sh -a`. This option will extract all media (pictures, sound, video) and files found in the iMessage database. They are organized by "conversation" in the subfolder named `Attachments`.

1. Run: cd (path of the downloaded baskup folder, i.e *cd ~/Downloads/baskup-master*)

2a. Run: *bash baskup.sh* to only backup messages ðŸ’¬

2b. Run: *bash baskup.sh -a* to backup messages AND attachments ðŸ’¬ + ðŸ“Ž

Your bask-up master folder will now begin to be filled with your backups. This may take some time, so be patient.

## All done

#### Within each directory you will find a directory for the attachments from that message, and the actual message text file.
